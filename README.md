# Harvard-S-14A-Final-Project

This project was created as the cumulative task in Harvard's S-14A course. The purpose of this project was to create a machine learning model to predict housing prices in Massachusets. The backend is based in Flask, and the data model was trained using Keras and Tensorflow. The final model had an R^2 score of 0.91. For this project, I was personally responsible for developing the machine learning model and Flask backend, while my group members developed the front-end of the website.
